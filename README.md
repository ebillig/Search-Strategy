Two sets of code, one for simulations to verify methodology and one for data analysis

1. data_code.R

This is the code used to analyze the data in Peru. For data de-idenfication purposes, data import and cleaning has been removed from the code. 

2. simulation_code.R

Results in paper done running 3 chains with different starting values for beta and Rb.
Ran in parallel using 20 different seeds (seeds 1:20). To run the entire file takes about a month on our computing cluster.
