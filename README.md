# Search-Strategy
code for manuscript on seach strategy for vectors

Two sets of code, one for simulations to verify methodology and one for data analysis

1. data analysis

2. Simulations

Results in paper done running 3 chains with different starting values for beta and Rb.
Ran in parallel using 20 different seeds (seeds 1:20) and two sets of starting values:

betastart=c(0.03,0.05,0.01)
Rbstart=c(1.2, 1.7, 2.3)

betastart=c(0.3,0.5,0.1)
Rbstart=c(2.2, 2.7, 2.3)
